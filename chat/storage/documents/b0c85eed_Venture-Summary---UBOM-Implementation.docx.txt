--- Part 1 ‑ Demand Demand Information: Demand/Project Title: Universal Bill of Materials (UBOM) Implementation Demand/Project #: [To be assigned] Sponsor: [To be assigned] Demand Manager: Jamie Lee – Venture Intake Manager Project Manager: To be assigned upon demand approval Priority Score: [To be assigned] Executive Summary: UBOM is a cornerstone of Molex’s digital thread, yet it remains under-leveraged both in manufacturing plants and within Global Product Development (GPD). Engineers still duplicate effort when searching for compliant, reusable components, and plants often recreate Manufacturing BOMs (MBOMs) manually. This venture proposes a two-pronged implementation: Enable full plant adoption of UBOM to automate MBOM creation and ensure real-time change propagation from EBOM. Deliver an AI-powered Teamcenter extension that mines historical EBOM/UBOM data to auto-suggest validated parts, reducing design-validation cycle time by 40 % and increasing part reuse by 30 %. Together these initiatives will prevent downstream errors, shorten design-to-manufacture lead-time, and institutionalise a single, trusted source of product structure data across Molex. --- Part 2 Section 1: Problem and Opportunity Statements Problem Statement: • UBOMs are not consistently used by manufacturing plants, and GPD engineers spend excessive time manually searching for compliant, reusable parts. This results in duplicate designs, longer cycle times, and manual MBOM re-work. Who has the problem? • Manufacturing plants (DSS, TIS, and others) that convert EBOMs to MBOMs • GPD mechanical, electrical, and packaging engineers using Teamcenter • Compliance teams who must re-check late BOM changes Opportunity Statement: • By enforcing UBOM as the single source of truth and layering an AI recommendation engine on top of existing Teamcenter/UBOM data, Molex can: – Push EBOM data automatically into UBOM and on to SAP – Generate MBOMs with minimal manual touch – Provide engineers real-time suggestions of previously validated, compliant parts, accelerating design and reducing re-work Section 2: Objective, Scope, and Benefits Objectives: Reduce average component-level design-validation cycle time by ≥ 40 %. Increase reuse of validated parts by ≥ 30 %. Push 100 % of EBOM items to UBOM, auto-creating a baseline MBOM in SAP. Embed compliance and substitute-part checks in the UBOM flow. Scope: • Functional: Teamcenter UBOM configuration, SAP MBOM interface, AI-based part-recommendation service, plant-level UBOM/MBOM training material. • Technical: Use existing Teamcenter-SAP integration; build AI model on historical EBOM/UBOM data (5 years). • Organizational: GPD, DSS, TIS, and initial pilot plants (to be selected). Benefits: • 3 hours saved per design cycle per engineer (thousands of hours annually). • 20 % reduction in compliance-related rework. • Error prevention through automated BOM comparison/validation. • Improved collaboration and visibility of substitute parts and component reuse. --- Part 3 Section 3: Alternatives, Recommendation, and Milestones Alternatives Considered: Status-quo (manual searches, ad-hoc MBOM creation) – low cost, low benefit. UBOM training only – improves MBOM creation but not design-cycle waste. Full UBOM rollout + AI recommendation engine (recommended). Recommendation: Proceed with Alternative 3: combine plant UBOM enablement with the AI Teamcenter extension to maximise both manufacturing and design-engineering benefits. High-Level Milestones: • Aug 2025 – Identify pilot plants and GPD pilot product lines • Oct 2025 – Complete AI prototype (90-day window) • Dec 2025 – Plant UBOM/MBOM training material finalised • Q1 2026 – AI pilot go-live in GPD; gather adoption metrics • Q2 2026 – UBOM-driven MBOM automation enabled in pilot plants • Q4 2026 – Phased rollout to remaining plants and product lines --- Part 4 Section 4: Resources, Financials, Risks, and Assumptions Resources: • 1 FTE Product Owner (GPD) • 2 FTE Teamcenter developers • 1 FTE Data Scientist (AI COE) • Part-time support from SAP integration team • External partner (Bold Arc Advisors) for model tuning (optional) • Training facilitators for plant enablement Financials: • AI prototype: [To be detailed] (licensing + modelling services) • Training & change-management: [To be detailed] • Ongoing run-costs (AI inference, maintenance): [To be detailed] • Existing Teamcenter/SAP infrastructure leveraged – no new platform spend. Risks: • Data-quality inconsistencies across legacy EBOMs → mitigated by cleansing sprint. • AI explainability concerns may slow adoption → provide traceable suggestion logs. • Plants may lack capacity to attend training → schedule flex weeks & recorded modules. Assumptions: • Access to five years of EBOM/UBOM data is granted. • No major Teamcenter upgrade conflicting with timeline. • Funding approved for minimal incremental cloud compute for AI model. --- Project Summary • Initial Project Scope: Deploy UBOM-centric process across selected plants and embed an AI recommendation engine inside Teamcenter for GPD. Excludes any non-Teamcenter PDM instances. • Project Deliverables: – Configured UBOM-to-SAP interface (production) – AI part-recommendation micro-service and Teamcenter plug-in – Cleansed historical EBOM/UBOM dataset – Training curriculum and e-learning modules for plant users – Updated SOPs for BOM governance and compliance checks • Project Approach: Agile, two parallel work-streams UBOM Enablement Stream – configuration, testing, plant pilots AI Stream – data prep, model build, Teamcenter integration • Project Schedule: See Milestones above; detailed sprint plan [To be detailed]. • Core Project Team: – Product Owner: Alex Rivera (Sr. Product Design Engineer) – Scrum Master / Project Manager: [To be assigned] – Technical Lead (Teamcenter): [To be assigned] – Data Science Lead: [To be assigned] – Change-Management Lead: [To be assigned] • Additional Digital Resources: AI COE, Molex Digital Engineering, Bold Arc Advisors (optional). • Costs: One-time prototype & rollout costs plus annual AI hosting/support; exact figures [To be detailed]. • Constraints/Limitations: Dependent on Teamcenter 14.2 upgrade being completed by Sept 2025; no budget for net-new on-prem hardware. • Dependencies: Teamcenter–SAP integration, Corporate AI Governance (Betty for Molex), Data-quality initiative. • Risk Assessment: Key risks listed in Section 4; probability/impact matrix [To be detailed]. • Assumptions: See Section 4. • Project Governance: – Monthly steering-committee (Sponsor, Product Owner, Digital Engineering) – Weekly stand-ups per work-stream – Issue escalation to Venture Intake Manager within 24 hrs • Long-Term Operational Model: – 0.5 FTE AI Model Ops engineer for retraining/monitoring – 1 FTE Teamcenter admin already in Digital Engineering covers UBOM maintenance – Vendor (if engaged) under 3-year support agreement • Approvals: Approval of this Venture Summary by Sponsor and Digital Engineering Leadership constitutes charter sign-off and authorises initiation of Phase 0 planning. ---
