Instruction The Venture Summary document is structured into two parts: Part 1 – Demand: This section is updated throughout the demand process and provides high-level information. Part 2 – Project: Updates in this section occur during the project's initiating phase and provides detailed information. The document includes the essential required details, but feel free to add any additional information as needed. Part 1-Demand Demand Information Executive Summary Summarize the problem, opportunity, cost, and benefits. Section 1: Problem and Opportunity Statements Problem Statement: Opportunity Statement: The UBOM primarily ensures that all the components of the EBOM are shared with SAP automatically. From the point of view of Manufacturing and Operations, they have a starting point for creating the MBOM. Additionally, changes to the EBOM are always reflected in the UBOM once the Design Review workflow is completed in Teamcenter. So, changes are communicated to the plants when their local coordinator is trained in Teamcenter. Additionally, the EBOM in Teamcenter creates the start of the basic data view in SAP for Material Masters. This saves plant Project Managers from having to initiate this work. Section 2: Objective, Scope and Benefits Objectives: EBOM data is typed only once and pushes to the UBOM Error prevention: Ensures accuracy of the EBOM for plants UBOM informs the EH&S BOS (Bill of substance) Efficiency: Prevents delays since every component in the UBOM requiring a compliance check is accounted for. SAP Material Master and basic views are automatically created and linked Efficiency: Prevents delays since a material master basic view exists for all items in the EBOM. This is automated through Teamcenter. Content in EBOM is searchable Efficiency: Enables where used in Teamcenter and encourages re-use of components An MBOM can be created in one week once the EBOM pushes to SAP as a UBOM Efficiency: Teamcenter notifies the local coordinators at the plants when the EBOM has been updated or ready for production release. Efficiency and error prevention: The items in the EBOM can be used as a starting point for creating the MBOM Manufacturing, Procurement and Operations get early insight (Phase 2 to Phase 3) on raw materials, components, etc. that are in the EBOM. Re-use and efficiency: Real time data speeds up decisions and enables earlier alignment on metal, plastic resin and ECAD component decisions for new products A better process for communicating substitute parts Approved and validated PD substitute raw materials and components are added in Teamcenter. These push to UBOM in SAP Scope: State any major topics/Applications that are in scope and out of scope, also include the approach In Scope: Leverage the existing technology built in Teamcenter and SAP for the EBOM and UBOM respectively. No digital resources are needed since this has already been deployed. Semi-automated change management for changes in Teamcenter that impact the UBOM. Training for all plants that work with Product Development teams that create new products in Teamcenter. Note there are 5 Molex plants successfully leveraging UBOMs in SAP Out of Scope A digital connection between the SAP UBOM and MBOM. This is the scope of another project and Venture Summary. A digital link between the change management used in Teamcenter and SAP (PCN). This is the scope of another project and Venture Summary. Benefits: (See objectives for more specifics) List Benefits/Values (Quantitative/Qualitative data) Efficiency Error Prevention Re-use Substitute raw materials and other commercial parts Section 3: Alternatives, Recommendation and Milestones Alternatives: Recommendation: Train the plants on using UBOMs See the benefits and objectives sections of this document for more detail on the value this recommended alternative provides. Milestones: List high level milestones + timeline Section 4: Resources, Financials, Risks and Assumptions Resources: Labor estimates and associated costs: Notes: More detailed resource planning, including hard booking, will occur during the Planning phase once the project is approved. Financials: Summary of financials, including request spend range needed for implementation, internal vs external spend by application, and 5-year cost benefit analysis (if applicable) No hard costs anticipated since the technology solution was already delivered as part of Fusion Phase 1. Minimal opportunity cost is required to identify plants for training and for capability leads to deliver this training. Risks/Dependencies: List known risks and their mitigation strategies Training plants that won’t have an opportunity to leverage UBOMs: Some plants only handle transfers of products from other Molex plants or from outside suppliers. The Product Development teams typically do not create an EBOM for these older products. So, no UBOM exists in SAP. Mitigation: Have the C3 determine which plants need to be trained Assumptions: The technology solution only needs to be maintained and requires no enhancement. Training was already developed by DSS Capability Leads. It’s assumed this is sufficient to train all other plants Appendix Demand team and Key stakeholders: Business Requirements: Add any high-level business requirements, if known (Document link can be provided) Product development teams will create an EBOM for all new products and variants of new products. Without this a UBOM cannot be systematically pushed to SAP. Architectural Diagrams: Add any architectural notes or diagrams (System and data flow) N/A Part 2-Project Initial Project Scope The scope defines project limits and identifies the products and/or services delivered by the project. The scope establishes the boundaries of the project. The project scope definition should also describe products and/or services that are outside of the project scope. Project Deliverables Project Approach Describe the project approach. Consider describing the approach in terms of: Solution approach (Build vs. Buy), Technology SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) Approach, Resourcing Approach, Testing Approach, etc. Project Schedule-Major Activity /Milestones Core Project Team Additional Digital Resources Costs Constraints/Limitations Describe the constraints and/or limiting factors that can affect the project. List constraints Dependencies Describe the dependencies that can affect the project. Include any dependencies on existing projects, work streams, and/or systems. List dependencies projects, initiatives, development items *** *** Risk Assessment Identify the risks that may impact the successful delivery of the end-product/result. The items should be tracked & managed via a Risk Log. Assumptions Describe the assumptions made in establishing this project’s requirements, scope, timeline, and budget. *** *** Project Governance Describe the project approach in terms of decision making and issue escalation.
