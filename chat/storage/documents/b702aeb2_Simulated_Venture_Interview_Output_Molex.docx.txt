Simulated Interview Output – Venture Summary Intake Request Interview Date: July 30, 2025 Duration: 30 minutes Stakeholder: Alex Rivera, Senior Product Design Engineer, Molex Global Product Development Facilitator: Jamie Lee, Venture Intake Manager Location: Virtual – Molex Global Product Development Futures Lab Call Meeting Type: Stakeholder Venture Summary Interview Meeting Purpose To gather foundational information for a proposed initiative to be considered as a Venture Summary. The stakeholder is submitting a new idea for an AI-powered application designed to improve design accuracy and efficiency within the Global Product Development (GPD) team. Interview Transcript Summary 1. Business/Organizational Outcomes Our goal is to reduce the average cycle time for component-level design validation by at least 40%, while increasing reuse of validated parts by 30%. With the high complexity and variation across customer demands, our engineers spend too much time cross-referencing prior designs. An AI-based system that can auto-suggest parts from past successful configurations—filtered by material, function, and compliance—would transform our design cycle and ensure better first-time quality. 2. Strategic Alignment This ties directly into Molex GPS and our Phase 2 Global Product Development modernization. We’re already pushing toward increased efficiency and reuse, and this application would amplify those efforts. It’s also aligned with the broader adoption of UBOM and Teamcenter, which are core to our digital thread and BOM automation strategies. 3. Value & Impact Biggest value? Time savings. Conservatively, we estimate this tool could save 3 hours per design cycle per engineer. Multiplied across GPD teams, that could mean thousands of hours reclaimed annually. The system would also improve compliance by flagging parts that don’t meet regional material regulations early in the design phase. That alone could reduce compliance-related rework by 20%. 4. Reusability & Scalability Initially, it’s targeted at GPD, but it has massive potential. Any team that touches Teamcenter—mechanical, electrical, even packaging—could use the same AI backbone to auto-classify, recommend, and optimize component selection. It’s modular by design. 5. Other Highlights - Problem Identified: Engineers spend excessive time manually searching for compliant, reusable components, often duplicating efforts. - Proposed Solution: An AI-powered extension to Teamcenter that uses natural language processing and prior design pattern mining to recommend validated parts and templates based on design intent. - Technical Foundation: Leverages existing Teamcenter + UBOM integration. Will use historical EBOM data as training corpus for the AI model. - Initial Ask: Design prototype, trained on historical project libraries, integrated into the GPD workspace. - Dependencies: Access to EBOM/UBOM data across past five years; coordination with Teamcenter integration teams; potential partner: Bold Arc Advisors or in-house AI COE. - Risks Identified: Data quality inconsistency across legacy records; need for explainability in AI suggestions to ensure adoption. - Timeline: Prototype within 90 days; phased rollout across product lines in 2026. Next Steps 1. Venture Summary Draft Creation – led by Jamie Lee, with Alex Rivera’s input. 2. Technology Assessment Meeting – scheduled with Molex Digital Engineering. 3. AI Governance Agent Review – ensure Betty for Molex is updated to track alignment with GPD goals. 4. Submit to Futures Lab for Innovation Council prioritization review – slated for Q4 2025.
