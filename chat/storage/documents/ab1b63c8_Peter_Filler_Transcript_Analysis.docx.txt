This focus reinforces a culture of excellence, role modeling, and performance-based identity. 📈 MARKET INSIGHTS Peter analyzes historical and current real estate volumes, comparing 2024 with past decades. Despite low transaction volumes, he argues this is not a traditional recession. Instead, he points to external pressures—interest rates, political polarization, and low inventory—while emphasizing that demand remains consistent due to ongoing life events. 💡 MINDSET & MOTIVATION He urges agents to challenge themselves, break habits, and not settle for 'sameness.'
