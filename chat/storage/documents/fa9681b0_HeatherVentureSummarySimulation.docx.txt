So I first would submit my request that says, you know, I think it takes a really long time for us to create venture summaries in our demand stage of the project initiation process. So I would like to do something about that. It would be awesome if we could leverage AI to help speed up that process. We often have stakeholders from many different countries in many different time zones with very busy schedules. So getting them all in one meeting together to contribute to writing a venture summary can be difficult. And then even when we do have those group conversations, progress is very incremental. We're able to meet for 30 or 60 minutes at a time. Those folks then have to go and ask other people to contribute content. And it's an iterative process where we're continuing to build information on top of what we've already learned, which is fine, but sometimes there can be a week or more in between these sessions. So the overall process is quite extended. And one thing that we're trying to achieve is to show that the demand process, while it does have structure and can provide great guidance for how to collect good information, is meant to be fast and nimble and show users that by coming to us with their project ideas, they're able to see results more quickly than they are today, that the barrier of entry is pretty low, and that they don't have to worry about how to navigate the digital organization, because we'll do that on their behalf, but we'll do it in a way that is quick and seamless for them, in a way that makes them want to work with us. So if I was going to elaborate on the problem statement, it's that overall, creating venture summaries is time consuming, given the number of people that are involved. It's a rather expensive exercise and often has a stretched timeline that means it's weeks, if not months, before we're ready for project approval and then planning and execution. The problem is experienced by the portfolio team, by the requesters, by any stakeholders that are involved in providing a proposed problem that they would like to have solved that we're not able to act on quickly enough for them. So what I would like to be able to do is create an interview platform where each of our demand stakeholders is able to contribute to the venture summary on their own time, a schedule that works for them, spending just 15 to 20 minutes answering some questions. And all of that information is then collated with the rest of the interview responses and a venture summary is produced without them having to spend any time in meetings. So far, we would still then like to bring that audience together for a final review and check. But we're replacing many meetings over the course of many weeks with a single meeting that already has content started for them. And currently we're not able to execute on that because we don't have any AI in this space. Everything is done very manually today. I think the opportunity is to make the demand process and the venture summary creation piece specifically easier able to be completed on the stakeholders' own schedule and much less complex. The aim is to create a venture summary that multiple people have contributed to in advance of any scheduled time with our stakeholders so they have something to read and react to. And we always say it's much easier to edit than author. So this gives them that starting point to react to. As far as scope, I think that we would want to include some sort of AI agents. We would want to make sure that we are incorporating prioritization matrix. We'd want to make sure that we're incorporating our outcomes-based thinking and we'd also want to make sure that we're looking at other existing demand and project information that may have an impact on the priority feasibility or resource availability for this particular effort. I think the benefits are that we're able to move through the venture summary creation process much faster than we are today, that it's easier for stakeholders to be a part of it, that we're collecting information from a broader set of users without any marginal additional overhead and that we're making the process more conversational in nature so that requesters don't feel that they need to provide all of the information, they can just provide the part that they are an expert in. We would want to engage our finance business partners, but probably not at this point, not as an initial interviewee. And I would also want to make sure that we are including some of our key resources throughout the build of this. So we want to make sure that we were looking at how an AI agent fits within the MOLEX ecosystem. We'd want to make sure that requirements are clear and provided by myself, other Arts, as well as Jeff Rose and probably a couple of other key folks in the portfolio space that need to be identified. And I think that's probably it for now. So I'm not sure what else I would add at this point.
