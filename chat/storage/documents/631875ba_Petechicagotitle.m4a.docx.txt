00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,139 [Speaker 0] You know, I was- I was telling Ken that I- I am very sure that he felt every one of those, every day for 40 years. 00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,500 [Speaker 1] [laughs] 00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,179 [Speaker 0] I think, Ken, it's the title business so it's 40 years times seven. 00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,219 [Speaker 1] [laughs] 00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:23,199 [Speaker 0] So it would be like 28, plus your normal years. So you're what? 290 years old? 00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,659 [Speaker 0] But you look a lot younger than that. You look like about 200. 00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,619 [Speaker 1] [laughs] 00:00:28,619 --> 00:02:28,819 [Speaker 0] It is... Congratulations. Wonderful. Wonderful. And by the way, thank you for saying, uh, thank you for thanking us for being a family. That- that personally means a lot 'cause that's how it feels. That's how it feels to me too. Um, I- I, um, I am really honored to be here. And I- I'm so thankful to be here. And I have to tell you guys honestly, this is truly the best part of my job. And I've had some really great parts in my job, and like y'all, I've got some kind of cracking parts in my job. But this is the best part. This is what I really, truly love the most. I'm- I'm so sorry I wasn't here for Mark Nasserway's, you know, recognition, um, this morning. Mark has been a wonderful guy for this company, you know, for a lot of years. And I- I think in what he has exemplified and is embodied, um, you know, for our effort and- and his leadership in the M&M part, really, it really speaks to really who we are, you know. Um, you don't always have to be the biggest, you guys. You just have to be the best. And- and then you have to be able to go home at night and live with yourself, um, and be true to yourself. It's that old saying, "It's not- it's not who you are when people are watching. It's who you are when people aren't watching." And that's what Mark was all about. That's what he, um, that's what he held close and exemplified. And- and I think that was very reflective of- of truly how he led. We're gonna- we're gonna miss him. We're very fortunate to have Robert Rivera, um, coming behind Mark. He's got big shoes to fill. But Robert exemplifies a lot of those- those, you know, those same things. And- and Alice, thank you for being here. Um, I- I, um, oh gosh, um, I can't start this without just breaking down. But, um, you know, you don't have to be religious to know that people live on. Um, and Annie lives on. She lives on in everybody here. I think about her every day. [microphone interference] 00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:51,579 [Speaker 0] Um, and I think about her spirit, and I think about the things that she overcame in the time that I- I knew her. And I think about her incredible daughter. And- and her daughter will be an honorary sales rep for this company for as long as I'm alive. And- and you are an honorary part of this family as well. And- and thank you for showing us grace and- and dignity in a very, very hard time. Thank you. 00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:55,219 [Speaker 1] [clapping]. 00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,999 [Speaker 0] And 00:02:56,999 --> 00:04:07,899 [Speaker 0] I just, you know, I talk about this being the, you know, the greatest part of my job. It's to be able to celebrate, you know, the collective success, you know, of this group in- in Southern California. And- and, you know, because you guys mean so much to me as well as all of these individual achievements and victories that, um, you know, that Howard, what Chicago Title did in Southern California in 2024. You know, we're- we're always gonna celebrate and recognize achievement, and especially- especially the extraordinary achievements. And, you know, we- we just got through handing out awards, and, you know, that's part of the extraordinary achievements. But to hear about people that did 40% more business, or 60% more business, you know, last year or the year before, that is truly extraordinary. I mean, it really is. For a person that did over a million and a half dollars in business, and- and really kind of what was less than a half of a year, I mean, absolutely amazing. You know, you extraordinary achievers, you become our role models. And from becoming a role model, you become our heroes. And when you become our heroes, 00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:20,479 [Speaker 0] you know, you help to open our eyes to what can be possible, as Bobby Tringo likes to say. Um, and- and ultimately, uh, to what is possible 00:04:20,479 --> 00:05:49,879 [Speaker 0] if we allow ourselves to dream and to think bigger. Um, I wanna thank everybody here for, you know, navigating through what was another, you know, fairly challenging year in the real estate business, not here just in Southern California, but, you know, all across the- the country. You know, similar to 2023, you know, after, you know, a- a steady, if not spectacular, you know, first half of the year, um, you know, we hit some headwinds in the second half. I was pretty excited, actually, as we got to the middle point of the year last year. Um, and we were forecasting that second half, you know, was gonna be pretty good. Second half of the year is always better than the- the first half of the year. But unfortunately, the interest rates, you know, crept in the wrong direction on us. Um, you know, listing inventories remained low, prices remained high. You throw a presidential election in a pretty polar country, polarized country in the middle of that, um, and the drama, and you- you- you had all the ingredients and enough reasons, you know, for y- for things to kind of fall backwards and- and- and slow down. Um, despite all of that, despite those headwinds, all of you collectively in this room, and- and the folks that weren't able to make it today, you generated over $100 million in revenue to the company last year, and $25 million in 2024. Give yourselves a round of applause. [clapping] 00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,999 [Speaker 0] Now, I wanna- I wanna, uh, call out, um- 00:05:53,999 --> 00:06:20,569 [Speaker 0] uh, some- some individual operational performances that, again, were truly extraordinary and- and stood out as exceptional. For all of you folks, uh, so- so in- in the western part of the United States, we have 91 w-... residential operations, what we call residential profit centers. That would be like Chicago Title Orange County would be a residential profit center. Chicago Title [laughs] In the entire 00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:46,829 [Speaker 0] 91 of them. Chicago Title Seattle. Chicago Title Santa Clara. Uh, um, Fidelity Title Las Vegas. Those are all residential profit centers in the west. 91 of those constitute the biggest title insurance company in the country. Out of those 91, you folks from Chicago Title San Diego finished number 11 out of 91. Congratulations. [clapping] 00:06:46,829 --> 00:07:02,549 [Speaker 0] That's in total pre-tax profit. And for all you folks at LA Ventura, you know, take a big bow because out of 91 operations you finished number four in the entire western US. [cheering] [clapping] 00:07:02,549 --> 00:08:54,129 [Speaker 0] And that's just, uh, the case each year. Uh, there was a group of Chicago Title salespeople whose contributions last year, you know, were truly extraordinary, uh, in our company and in the industry itself. And it's a big honor for me to be able to take a minute now and acknowledge the 24 class of Chicago Title sales executives in Southern California who qualified for the Fidelity National Title Group National Top 10 Awards. As a company, our parent, FNTG, commands approximately 41% of the direct title insurance market share in the United States. And we have a little over 1,350 salespeople that work for us across the country. To qualify for the top 10% nationally, you not only have to be the top operation, the top rep executive of your operation likely, or even amongst the top salespeople amongst this group, but you need to stand out amongst 347 people in Southern California that are under the F&F umbrella. That distinction, because by the way, we command about 46% of the market share, F&F commands about 46% of the market share in Southern California among the, amongst the entire industry. So if you can rank in the top 10 folks in that group, you're truly the best in the business. So I'd like to first recognize the team qualifiers for Chicago Title Southern California. The first one hails out of Orange County, our home county, here for the rally this year, Team Chicago. Jessica, Nate, and Laurie Brager. [cheering] [clapping] 00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:03,669 [Speaker 0] Congratulations. For any of you with pens, you finished number seven out of 46 teams amongst all F&TG in Southern California. Great job you guys. 00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,489 [Speaker 2] Thank you. 00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:32,509 [Speaker 0] The next team I want to recognize also hails out of Orange County. These- these two are just fantastic sales guys. Sales, just fantastic title pros. Um, it's a pleasure to work with them. Um, I love how they attack problems. Uh, that's Brandon and Kevin. You guys ranked number four out of 46 teams, and you finished in the top 5% of all of our teams. [clapping] 00:09:32,509 --> 00:10:09,249 [Speaker 0] Congratulations. Our next team, and this team has made it every year, um, as has- as has the two teams I read previously. This team is very near and dear to me. I've- I've, um, had the honor of working with them for a long, long time since the late '90s. Uh, they hail out of Los Angeles, uh, headed up by Anna Mah, um, the matriarch of this team, who is the epitome of grace and elegance and professionalism. The Mah team, uh, finished in the top five. They ranked number three out of 46 teams in Southern California. Congratulations. [clapping] 00:10:09,249 --> 00:11:03,329 [Speaker 0] And our top team, this is the top team amongst all teams that work for Chicago Fidelity Lawyers and Title Corp in Southern California, as measured by title revenue only. This team hails out of Los Angeles. They are a powerhouse. And, uh, they've got my little dy- dynamo there, Tayleen, who is my, uh, my, uh, you know, she's always going to be my li- I always call her my lucky charm. She always kind of looks at me like, "Why do you call me, why do you call me your lucky charm?" Because we're both the same size, Tayleen. That's why. [laughing] How cute. I'm not going to tell you guys where you rank because I'm supposed to hold that back for the national top performers awards ceremony in Las Vegas in May. You ranked number one amongst all teams in Southern California. [clapping] 00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:42,289 [Speaker 0] And then the last team I want to acknowledge are two guys that, um, you know all too well. These guys are what we would call in sports five tool players. Um, they have it all. They are phenomenal sales, uh, uh, people. They are incredibly knowledgeable about all aspects of real estate. Now they're running sales teams under the Inland Empire. They were the top team in Southern California if you rank combined title and escrow together, top team out of 46, almost 5 million in revenue. That's Bobby and Mike. [clapping] 00:11:42,289 --> 00:12:51,673 [Speaker 0] So as far as the individual qualifiers go, and this is, uh, this is fun too, I want to first acknowledge the, um, the top 10% of our Chicago Title salespeople that made the national top performers. Um, and I'll go down in order. Our first qualifier was Scott Bailey. He actually finished, Scott finished as an individual number four total in combined title and escrow revenue. Congratulations, Scott.Dan McPherson. Dan McPherson: And this is, uh- this is at about 300 and- 300 and, uh, ten reps in Southern California for all of our brands. Fran Hobson, you finished number 36 out of that group. [applause] All right. Congratulations. Cassie, you finished number 35. Congratulations. [applause] Kyle Avlin, it's just been a joy to watch you grow. You're in, you're on. Just stay focused. Don't let the distractions pull you down. You know, you're an inspiration to us. You're a big part of this family, and whatever you need from this family to keep yourself moving forward with everything that's happened to you, you just ask. That's all you gotta do. 34. Congratulations. [applause] Whoo! 00:12:51,673 --> 00:13:05,333 [Speaker 0] My good luck charm who I've known for 25 years. First met her in Vegas, um, as a sales executive up there when I first became original. Jodi Borelli, 32. Congratulations, Jodi. [applause] Whoo. 00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:10,333 [Speaker 0] And our good luck Danny Fan, who'll always- will always live on 00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:16,833 [Speaker 0] with all of us. He finished 31. Incredible. [applause] 00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,493 [Speaker 0] Wow. Terry, poor Terry. Where is he? He moved on. 00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:21,913 [Speaker 3] He stopped doing work. 00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:34,613 [Speaker 0] He's having a problem. [laughs] He finished 27 in six months. [laughs] Wow. Not bad. [applause] Lisa Murphey, you finished 22. Whoo! [applause] Out of 310. 00:13:34,613 --> 00:14:43,213 [Speaker 0] Cameron- Cameron finished 21. Uh, as measured by title only, number five total title and escrow revenue combined. And then if I break it down to the top 5%, I won't say whether or not you made five or two, because again, you're supposed to show up in Vegas, and that's when we're gonna tell you if you were five or two. Nathan Starks. Whoo! [applause] By the way, you're not Nathan. Nathan, we're completely changing your name. We're gonna do a forced intervention and change your name. It's Starks now. Starks. Yes, everything from here on out's gonna be Starks. You were 17 out of over 300 reps. Whoo! [applause] Mary Thompson, who's not here. Love Mary. She finished 15 out of that group. And then this next guy who I've just watched grown up, you know, from being a kid, with so much energy, so rambunctious. Great golfer, even back then. And always super good-looking. But boy has he put it all together, and time has- is- is- has helped him to mature. He finished 12 out of everybody in Southern California, Chris Jones. Whoo! [applause] 00:14:43,213 --> 00:15:02,173 [Speaker 0] Wow. And then our one and our only, she is, as you guys all know, an, um, a complete unicorn. Um, impossible to replicate, possibly to duplicate, um, because it's authenticity and energy, um, and just a love for people and the love of life that just 00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:18,993 [Speaker 0] causes this person to be who she is. And that's Christine Thompson. She finished five. And she finished number two if you combined her title and her escrow revenue together, and she's our flag bearer, and I know we're all so very proud of her. Congratulations, Christine. [applause] 00:15:18,993 --> 00:16:21,913 [Speaker 0] And the last person I wanna recognize, I know he's here 'cause I love the blue sweater that he's got on, but Joe Salvatore is another guy who's really a unicorn. He focuses on selling escrow. And as you all know, everybody here in this room all knows how difficult it is to cross-sell escrow. It is just a minefield. You know, when every one of your big broker customers owns their own escrow company, go try that on for size, you guys. Go try to go step out your door in the morning and generate over $3.2 million in revenue knowing everywhere you step is enemy territory. And he is- he's able to do that year in, year out. And it's a remarkable achievement. You know, the- the branch that he oversees is- is one of the most successful branches that we have in Southern California. Just gigantic, gigantic accomplishment. And we're so lucky to have him. Uh, just a- a couple of comments about the market, and, you know, kinda how we're looking at this year. But here's some good news. I'm not gonna take an hour and a half. I think I'm already up to 29 minutes, so, so he's gonna have to go really fast. [laughs] Um, 00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:31,273 [Speaker 0] you know, uh, because I've had a few people that have been asking me about what we think is- is gonna happen, you know, this year. You know, like I said last year, you have to go back to 1990-
