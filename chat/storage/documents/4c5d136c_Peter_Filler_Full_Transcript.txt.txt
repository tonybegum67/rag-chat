--- Pete Filler Sales Rally --- 00:00:00,079 --> 00:04:11,539 [Speaker 0] ... of homes, resale homes and condos, changed hands. Um, that's mind-boggling, you know, for me to think that. That's 30 years ago, right? That's 30 years ago, um, that you have to go backwards to find a year where the volumes were similar to what we saw in 2024. Um, now what makes that an even greater paradox to me is that the country has 70 million more people today in it than we had in our population [laughs] in 1995. So we're 70 million people bigger, but the number of real estate transactions that took place here last year was the same number. Anybody see a problem there [laughs]? I see a huge problem. I see a lot of people that, that, um, that don't own homes that need to own homes. Um, you know, and, and although, you know, if you, uh, for some of you oldies but goldies like me that do remember '95, '96, it was a pretty severe real estate recession. Um, it wasn't quite as bad as the crash, but it was, it was really quite nasty. It was, uh, it came off of the heels of the failure of the savings loan industry across the country. Um, and there were a lot of foreclosures and a lot of, you know, short sales. I think that's when short sales first got, first got invented. Uh, deed in liens, all that stuff. Uh, unemployment was high. Gas was high, all that stuff. Um, you know, so we can't compare ourselves today to that because although these volumes would suggest that we're in a real estate recession, um, w- we're really not in a real estate recession. Uh, we, we don't have the factors that typically accompany a traditional real estate recession. Um, that those factors would be like high inventory levels, um, you know, downward pressure on, on home prices, um, and, and a lot of loan defaults and foreclosures and people just totally stressed out. I mean, none of that, none of that really exists. I mean, uh, the foreclosure rates are really s- still historically quite low. Um, banks just don't like to foreclose anymore, so they do a lot of workouts and, and that kind of stuff. I mean, a lot of stress in the marketplace on real estate agents 'cause there's probably too many of them out there. Um, but, uh, home sellers are still, you know, sitting in a, in a, uh, pretty, uh, prime position. Yeah, we think that the year's gonna play out in two halves, just like I, I was up here last year saying the, the same thing. Uh, the first half, although, you know, we're still affected by, you know, the higher interest rates and, and relatively low inventory levels, w- we're seeing a spring selling season, um, you know, where the volumes typically pick up in, in March through June. And we're seeing it now. I'll give you some, just a, a little bit of taste of that. Uh, the openings in March, uh, is we measure on a per day basis because that's how mana- managers always do it. Um, our up 4% over February, in, in February, uh, experienced a really nice pick up over January at 12%. Um, typically what we see, you guys, in a normalized market, December always falls. And then orders on a per day basis, and I'm talking resale orders, they typically jump up about 25% in January and about another 5% in February. This year they jumped up 28% in January, and then in February they jumped up 12%. March we usually see very flat to February. But we're up 4% so far in March. So, um, and here's a little bit of good news. So far in March we're up 13% overall up against last year, up against last March. So, um, I'm giving you that because be careful about what you're, what you're reading, you know, with all the stats out there or when the real estate agents are panicking and tell you, "Oh my God, my business is down, you know, from last year." And it could be, but our business overall is up and the overall trends appear to be slowly but surely, you know, kinda heading in the right direction. Now, our orders up 13%, you know, you could throw a few refis in there, but when I break it down, the resells are, are carrying most of that. So that's really good, you know, really good news. The second half of the year is gonna be a little bit harder to predict. I mean, it's, 00:04:11,539 --> 00:05:52,939 [Speaker 0] you know, I mean, I only have an opinion like, like everybody else does. We've got some crosswinds that are kinda hitting us right now. We got tariffs. You know, we've got these, uh, those cuts in federal spending, and, and a lot of general worries about inflation, you know, still, uh, in the marketplace and, and, and maybe how all this could, you know, could hit the economy and, and could make an, an impact. But, you know, here's the thing. W- we, we still think despite all of that, um, that the second half has got potential for positive momentum, you know, uh, to, to start to generate, uh, that can carry us through a nice second half of the year. Why do I say that? I mean, we think that there's a decent prospect that we'll have modestly lower interest rates, um, in the second half. Uh, Chris Jones, I don't know if we'll see a 5.9, but we're gonna see low sixes. That'll be kind of the baseline rate, you know, as we, as we start to move through the second half. You guys will get better inventory. I'm already hearing that. A lot of my real estate agent friends are telling me that, you know, the houses are sitting longer, you know? It, uh... And that's not a bad thing. I mean, you know, you could look at that and say, "Oh my God, the sales are slowing down." Those stats I just gave you are kind of suggesting otherwise. Market, house is sitting out there a little longer isn't the worst thing. That helps buyers out a little bit, right? Because- because you don't want too few houses out there that are just flying off the shelves because that just keeps ratcheting up prices. And prices that are too high, I've always said that to everybody that's always asked, that's the number one thing that I think ruins markets, is just prices that are unsustainable. Um, you know, and we're gonna see an honest pickup in refi orders in the second half of the year. Hey, if there was a lot of adjustable rate mortgages that were done in '18, '19 and '20 00:05:52,939 --> 00:05:54,059 [Speaker 1] [coughs] 00:05:54,059 --> 00:05:59,219 [Speaker 0] uh, those 7/1 ARMs... Where's John Barr? Why did you talk me into a 7/1 ARM- 00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:00,119 [Speaker 1] [coughs] 00:06:01,507 --> 00:06:37,327 [Speaker 0] [laughs] God, I got one of those things and now I gotta worry about it. [laughs] Just kidding. [laughs] Sorry. [laughs] You're good. But hey, uh, barring a recession, I mean, we, we think, and we think the chances of that are pretty low, um, we're, we're gonna have a better second half, you guys, than we had, uh, in the second half of, of, of, uh, 2024. Um, you know, and re- regarding that and regarding my best guess, I just don't want anybody to ever let up lose sight of the fact that there are always people selling homes and there are always people buying homes. 00:06:37,327 --> 00:07:41,107 [Speaker 0] And there's always people selling homes and buying homes when interest rates are higher and when interest rates are lower. So don't lose sight of that. More than half of the real estate market's activity and up cycles and down cycles are driven by the five big Ds and the two big Rs, right? Uh, diplomas, diamonds, diapers, uh, uh, divorces, and, and, and dislocations, and then the two R's, relocations and retirements, and, and then deaths. So that stuff just keeps on happening regardless of what happens in the economy, right? People keep dying. People keep getting divorced. You know, people keep getting relocated to other parts of the country. Uh, people's kids, you know, uh, go off to college and, uh, graduate from college and they get to downsize. Um, those life events keep on keeping on, and, uh, that, that keeps the real estate market kind of moving along, regardless of what happens in the, in the big picture in the background. Um, 00:07:41,107 --> 00:08:43,307 [Speaker 0] you know, if any of you here looked upon the market and said to yourself, "You know, this is, this is a challenging market," you know, I, I, I would certainly understand that. I could certainly understand that. But, you know, if you all also looked out at this market and you said, "This is a market that's gonna help me separate myself from everybody else," I'd also completely understand that comment too. Uh, a- and, uh, it's because when people, uh, are busy and markets are robust, I talked about this last week, right? When, when markets are busy, people are busy- [coughs] ... clients are busy and markets are doing really well, uh, it's, it's harder to make a case for change. It's harder to make a case to do something different to a Realtor than what they're doing. But when markets aren't so robust and when markets are changing and people are struggling in that... And we know there's a lot of struggling real estate agents. A lot of agents haven't done a deal in three months or whatever it's been, or six months. You know, they're, they're struggling to adapt. You have an opportunity to do something different and you have an opportunity to be something different. 00:08:43,307 --> 00:08:43,687 [Speaker 2] Yeah. 00:08:43,687 --> 00:10:49,387 [Speaker 0] And you always wanna keep that in mind. You know, Tom Ferry has brought us a lot of really good nuggets, in my opinion. Are, are you with me on that? Okay. There's a lot of good stuff that the guy's, the guy's, guy's brought. And, uh, I can't always follow him and I can't always write fast enough to, you know, to follow him at, at the, at the Listing Edge events or even events he does for, for, for us. But, but the one thing that he has said that has constantly stuck with me is how we can't afford to be the same. And, and every day I tell myself that. That we can't afford to be the same. What do I need to change in myself that will make my outcome different? And I wanna challenge you. You know, we wanna challenge you all on that. Um, you know, you, you can't afford to stay the same. You can a- afford to stay largely the same, but you can't afford to stay exactly the same. So as you, as you get out of here, you leave today, you go back and you charge into your territories, you know, next week, we're almost three months down. You got three quarters to go to be able to make an impact on this year and, and make the outcome not the same. Something different. You know, I look around this gorgeous ballroom that we're in, and it's really cool because we had a rally here. Rick, we had a rally here a long time ago. We did. I think this hotel was only about a year old. Um, and I remember Dave, you know, suggesting that we come here for the rally. I thought he was crazy. Izzy Land? But it, and I remember coming here and thinking how beautiful the place was, and, um, did we get a group rate on any of the rooms, by the way? [laughs] I hope so. Somebody was telling me they're like 1,000 a night or something. Boy, times changed. Yeah, I looked out at this beautiful ballroom and I can't help but think to myself, "Who's gonna be tomorrow's three million dollar, uh, year producer in this group?" And I can speculate and I look around and I see some faces, and I can speculate to myself, "Who's it gonna be?" 00:10:49,387 --> 00:13:59,499 [Speaker 0] You know, it's like, "Who's gonna be that next Christine Gilmour? You know, who's gonna be the next Jerry Woo or, or maybe Chris Jones or, or Starks?" Uh, one thing that I know is that these superstars are being created right now, today, around Southern California. It may not show in their numbers and it may not show up in a rally like this today, and it may not even be this year, it may not be next, but because of their passion, their willingness to try new things, their willingness to take chances, to constantly challenge themselves and not ever accept being in the middle, not ever accepting in the middle, they're gonna get there. And they will prove to themselves and everybody else around them what is possible. What is possible. You know, I've personally gotten so much from this relationship that we have with Tom Ferry. I hope that each of you found at least some good stuff. But as good as that stuff is, as I said last year, it's what you do with that stuff and how you are gonna run with it that make the results. And Tom emphasizes that. It's the do. It's the do. That's how you get there. You know, Brad focused s-... some years back when I was doing those videos. And I remember him telling me and laughing how bad he sucked at it. [laughs] You know, now the guy's like a deal in San Diego, and I mean outside of the real estate industry for how good his videos are. You know, a funny quick little story. Uh, you know, my, my brother-in-law, uh, called me up, and I haven't even told you this. I'm supposed to tell you. I'm sorry. He already knew. I didn't tell you. Oh, he emailed you. Yeah. My o- my brother-in-law calls me up about three months ago. And my, my brother-in-law at one time was a big deal in San Diego as a landscape architect. I mean, he, he, he... A very, very fine landscape architect. President, American Landscape Architects Association in the country. Um, and, and a very high-end designer. Qualcomm was his top client. He's designed projects at the San Diego Zoo, um, and at Sea World. And one of his crowning achievements was Freedom Park in San Diego, uh, which many of you, um, from San Diego might know as the park e- uh, it, it... Directly adjacent to the Midway Museum, which is the floating aircraft carrier down in the bay. And it's the... Freedom Park has got this big statue of the, of the sol- the soldier kissing the, uh, the, uh, the GI kissing the, uh, the gal in, in Italy. And, um, and, um... E- My brother-in-law, uh, knows Brad. But, uh, but a lot of people follow my brother-in-law, and I think a lot of people Googled Freedom Park, and they saw Brad's video. Brad did a video on Freedom Park, which was just impeccable. It was just great. And my brother had the audacity to call me to want to correct a fact on Brad's video. [laughs] How cool is that? And, and I didn't get to tell you this, but I was flying somewhere about six months ago, and I, I chatted it up with a guy on the plane. Again, nobody in the real estate business in San Diego. And I said, "Hey, you know that Brad Hobson?" "Yeah, that Around San Diego video stuff that he does is really cool." I just started laughing. I didn't tell him that I've known you since high school. [laughs] It was pretty-... Hey, you're creating a following down there. And you guys, it's generating business. 00:13:59,499 --> 00:14:03,679 [Speaker 0] Almost $1.5 million. So pretty cool. 00:14:03,679 --> 00:14:05,199 [Speaker 0] Um, 00:14:05,199 --> 00:14:23,299 [Speaker 0] I looked here, and I challenged everybody last year on this. Um, a third of you at the end of this year are gonna be ahead. A third of you are gonna be exactly the same. You're gonna finish exactly the ei- the same place that you finished in '24. And a third of you are gonna finish less. 00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:43,359 [Speaker 0] Um, and why do I say that? Why do I predict it? Because that's just generally how it always works out. A, a, a third of our sales executives are ahead. A third are about the same. And a third fall behind. I want so desperately for each of you to be ahead, and to be ahead by a ton. 00:14:43,359 --> 00:15:23,099 [Speaker 0] Uh, and as does Steve, and as does Nate, and as does Ryan, and as does Ryan Olenick who's not here, and John Barr, and everybody else. Robert. But we can't make those choices for you. Y- you have to make those choices. The best that we can do is to put a fantastic platform underneath. The best one that we can... The best one we can manufacture, envelop you all in a culture of support, uh, and positivity, uh, a- and, and then get out of the way, and, and let you do this thing. Always remember, your greatest competition is yourself. Your greatest competitor is you. 00:15:23,099 --> 00:16:27,639 [Speaker 0] Your greatest competitor is you. I would never close this event without acknowledging all the people that support you here and your success journey each and every day. And, and I can tell you, having the honor to work with these folks, they, they truly put their passion and their hearts in- into what they do. I, I think you see it. Um, and they are all here, you know, for you, and supporting your success and having your backs. Um, and I- and I want to recognize them. Uh, I wanna... And I wanna recognize the people that, um, that put on the rally too. But I first wanna recognize the county managers. If you can stand. Mark's naturally is not here, but Robert, if you could stand. Robert Rivera and the Inland Empire. Ryan Watson. [clapping and cheering]. Bryan Lin from San Diego, Bruce overseas. And your Southern California regional manager for Chicago Title in, in Los Angeles, Ventura County manager, Steve Perry. [clapping and cheering] 00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:39,839 [Speaker 0] And I wanna acknowledge the sales managers also put their time and effort into this event and, and in leading you each and every day. From Chicago Title San Diego, John Barr. John? [clapping and cheering] Yeah. 00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:59,819 [Speaker 0] From the Inland Empire, uh, Bobby Tarango and Mike Arias. [clapping and cheering] Yeah. Appreciate you guys. And from the biggest county of all, uh, the biggest badass of all, Nate Chappelle, Los Angeles. [clapping and cheering] Woo. 00:16:59,819 --> 00:17:19,699 [Speaker 0] You know, a big shout out one more time to the sponsors, uh, you know, that, that, uh, are here to support you, put up their time and effort, you know, contributed to underwriting this event. From GCC Promotional, Laura. Uh, the Cato folks, Michael Lamb and Caitlin. Um, uh, Brandon, uh, from Prof- Wise Agent. Is Brandon still here? --- Pete Chicago Title --- 00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:10,139 [Speaker 0] You know, I was- I was telling Ken that I- I am very sure that he felt every one of those, every day for 40 years. 00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:11,500 [Speaker 1] [laughs] 00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,179 [Speaker 0] I think, Ken, it's the title business so it's 40 years times seven. 00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:16,219 [Speaker 1] [laughs] 00:00:16,219 --> 00:00:23,199 [Speaker 0] So it would be like 28, plus your normal years. So you're what? 290 years old? 00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,659 [Speaker 0] But you look a lot younger than that. You look like about 200. 00:00:26,659 --> 00:00:28,619 [Speaker 1] [laughs] 00:00:28,619 --> 00:02:28,819 [Speaker 0] It is... Congratulations. Wonderful. Wonderful. And by the way, thank you for saying, uh, thank you for thanking us for being a family. That- that personally means a lot 'cause that's how it feels. That's how it feels to me too. Um, I- I, um, I am really honored to be here. And I- I'm so thankful to be here. And I have to tell you guys honestly, this is truly the best part of my job. And I've had some really great parts in my job, and like y'all, I've got some kind of cracking parts in my job. But this is the best part. This is what I really, truly love the most. I'm- I'm so sorry I wasn't here for Mark Nasserway's, you know, recognition, um, this morning. Mark has been a wonderful guy for this company, you know, for a lot of years. And I- I think in what he has exemplified and is embodied, um, you know, for our effort and- and his leadership in the M&M part, really, it really speaks to really who we are, you know. Um, you don't always have to be the biggest, you guys. You just have to be the best. And- and then you have to be able to go home at night and live with yourself, um, and be true to yourself. It's that old saying, "It's not- it's not who you are when people are watching. It's who you are when people aren't watching." And that's what Mark was all about. That's what he, um, that's what he held close and exemplified. And- and I think that was very reflective of- of truly how he led. We're gonna- we're gonna miss him. We're very fortunate to have Robert Rivera, um, coming behind Mark. He's got big shoes to fill. But Robert exemplifies a lot of those- those, you know, those same things. And- and Alice, thank you for being here. Um, I- I, um, oh gosh, um, I can't start this without just breaking down. But, um, you know, you don't have to be religious to know that people live on. Um, and Annie lives on. She lives on in everybody here. I think about her every day. [microphone interference] 00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:51,579 [Speaker 0] Um, and I think about her spirit, and I think about the things that she overcame in the time that I- I knew her. And I think about her incredible daughter. And- and her daughter will be an honorary sales rep for this company for as long as I'm alive. And- and you are an honorary part of this family as well. And- and thank you for showing us grace and- and dignity in a very, very hard time. Thank you. 00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:55,219 [Speaker 1] [clapping]. 00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,999 [Speaker 0] And 00:02:56,999 --> 00:04:07,899 [Speaker 0] I just, you know, I talk about this being the, you know, the greatest part of my job. It's to be able to celebrate, you know, the collective success, you know, of this group in- in Southern California. And- and, you know, because you guys mean so much to me as well as all of these individual achievements and victories that, um, you know, that Howard, what Chicago Title did in Southern California in 2024. You know, we're- we're always gonna celebrate and recognize achievement, and especially- especially the extraordinary achievements. And, you know, we- we just got through handing out awards, and, you know, that's part of the extraordinary achievements. But to hear about people that did 40% more business, or 60% more business, you know, last year or the year before, that is truly extraordinary. I mean, it really is. For a person that did over a million and a half dollars in business, and- and really kind of what was less than a half of a year, I mean, absolutely amazing. You know, you extraordinary achievers, you become our role models. And from becoming a role model, you become our heroes. And when you become our heroes, 00:04:07,899 --> 00:04:20,479 [Speaker 0] you know, you help to open our eyes to what can be possible, as Bobby Tringo likes to say. Um, and- and ultimately, uh, to what is possible 00:04:20,479 --> 00:05:49,879 [Speaker 0] if we allow ourselves to dream and to think bigger. Um, I wanna thank everybody here for, you know, navigating through what was another, you know, fairly challenging year in the real estate business, not here just in Southern California, but, you know, all across the- the country. You know, similar to 2023, you know, after, you know, a- a steady, if not spectacular, you know, first half of the year, um, you know, we hit some headwinds in the second half. I was pretty excited, actually, as we got to the middle point of the year last year. Um, and we were forecasting that second half, you know, was gonna be pretty good. Second half of the year is always better than the- the first half of the year. But unfortunately, the interest rates, you know, crept in the wrong direction on us. Um, you know, listing inventories remained low, prices remained high. You throw a presidential election in a pretty polar country, polarized country in the middle of that, um, and the drama, and you- you- you had all the ingredients and enough reasons, you know, for y- for things to kind of fall backwards and- and- and slow down. Um, despite all of that, despite those headwinds, all of you collectively in this room, and- and the folks that weren't able to make it today, you generated over $100 million in revenue to the company last year, and $25 million in 2024. Give yourselves a round of applause. [clapping] 00:05:49,879 --> 00:05:53,999 [Speaker 0] Now, I wanna- I wanna, uh, call out, um- 00:05:53,999 --> 00:06:20,569 [Speaker 0] uh, some- some individual operational performances that, again, were truly extraordinary and- and stood out as exceptional. For all of you folks, uh, so- so in- in the western part of the United States, we have 91 w-... residential operations, what we call residential profit centers. That would be like Chicago Title Orange County would be a residential profit center. Chicago Title [laughs] In the entire 00:06:20,569 --> 00:06:46,829 [Speaker 0] 91 of them. Chicago Title Seattle. Chicago Title Santa Clara. Uh, um, Fidelity Title Las Vegas. Those are all residential profit centers in the west. 91 of those constitute the biggest title insurance company in the country. Out of those 91, you folks from Chicago Title San Diego finished number 11 out of 91. Congratulations. [clapping] 00:06:46,829 --> 00:07:02,549 [Speaker 0] That's in total pre-tax profit. And for all you folks at LA Ventura, you know, take a big bow because out of 91 operations you finished number four in the entire western US. [cheering] [clapping] 00:07:02,549 --> 00:08:54,129 [Speaker 0] And that's just, uh, the case each year. Uh, there was a group of Chicago Title salespeople whose contributions last year, you know, were truly extraordinary, uh, in our company and in the industry itself. And it's a big honor for me to be able to take a minute now and acknowledge the 24 class of Chicago Title sales executives in Southern California who qualified for the Fidelity National Title Group National Top 10 Awards. As a company, our parent, FNTG, commands approximately 41% of the direct title insurance market share in the United States. And we have a little over 1,350 salespeople that work for us across the country. To qualify for the top 10% nationally, you not only have to be the top operation, the top rep executive of your operation likely, or even amongst the top salespeople amongst this group, but you need to stand out amongst 347 people in Southern California that are under the F&F umbrella. That distinction, because by the way, we command about 46% of the market share, F&F commands about 46% of the market share in Southern California among the, amongst the entire industry. So if you can rank in the top 10 folks in that group, you're truly the best in the business. So I'd like to first recognize the team qualifiers for Chicago Title Southern California. The first one hails out of Orange County, our home county, here for the rally this year, Team Chicago. Jessica, Nate, and Laurie Brager. [cheering] [clapping] 00:08:54,129 --> 00:09:03,669 [Speaker 0] Congratulations. For any of you with pens, you finished number seven out of 46 teams amongst all F&TG in Southern California. Great job you guys. 00:09:03,669 --> 00:09:04,489 [Speaker 2] Thank you. 00:09:04,489 --> 00:09:32,509 [Speaker 0] The next team I want to recognize also hails out of Orange County. These- these two are just fantastic sales guys. Sales, just fantastic title pros. Um, it's a pleasure to work with them. Um, I love how they attack problems. Uh, that's Brandon and Kevin. You guys ranked number four out of 46 teams, and you finished in the top 5% of all of our teams. [clapping] 00:09:32,509 --> 00:10:09,249 [Speaker 0] Congratulations. Our next team, and this team has made it every year, um, as has- as has the two teams I read previously. This team is very near and dear to me. I've- I've, um, had the honor of working with them for a long, long time since the late '90s. Uh, they hail out of Los Angeles, uh, headed up by Anna Mah, um, the matriarch of this team, who is the epitome of grace and elegance and professionalism. The Mah team, uh, finished in the top five. They ranked number three out of 46 teams in Southern California. Congratulations. [clapping] 00:10:09,249 --> 00:11:03,329 [Speaker 0] And our top team, this is the top team amongst all teams that work for Chicago Fidelity Lawyers and Title Corp in Southern California, as measured by title revenue only. This team hails out of Los Angeles. They are a powerhouse. And, uh, they've got my little dy- dynamo there, Tayleen, who is my, uh, my, uh, you know, she's always going to be my li- I always call her my lucky charm. She always kind of looks at me like, "Why do you call me, why do you call me your lucky charm?" Because we're both the same size, Tayleen. That's why. [laughing] How cute. I'm not going to tell you guys where you rank because I'm supposed to hold that back for the national top performers awards ceremony in Las Vegas in May. You ranked number one amongst all teams in Southern California. [clapping] 00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:42,289 [Speaker 0] And then the last team I want to acknowledge are two guys that, um, you know all too well. These guys are what we would call in sports five tool players. Um, they have it all. They are phenomenal sales, uh, uh, people. They are incredibly knowledgeable about all aspects of real estate. Now they're running sales teams under the Inland Empire. They were the top team in Southern California if you rank combined title and escrow together, top team out of 46, almost 5 million in revenue. That's Bobby and Mike. [clapping] 00:11:42,289 --> 00:12:51,673 [Speaker 0] So as far as the individual qualifiers go, and this is, uh, this is fun too, I want to first acknowledge the, um, the top 10% of our Chicago Title salespeople that made the national top performers. Um, and I'll go down in order. Our first qualifier was Scott Bailey. He actually finished, Scott finished as an individual number four total in combined title and escrow revenue. Congratulations, Scott.Dan McPherson. Dan McPherson: And this is, uh- this is at about 300 and- 300 and, uh, ten reps in Southern California for all of our brands. Fran Hobson, you finished number 36 out of that group. [applause] All right. Congratulations. Cassie, you finished number 35. Congratulations. [applause] Kyle Avlin, it's just been a joy to watch you grow. You're in, you're on. Just stay focused. Don't let the distractions pull you down. You know, you're an inspiration to us. You're a big part of this family, and whatever you need from this family to keep yourself moving forward with everything that's happened to you, you just ask. That's all you gotta do. 34. Congratulations. [applause] Whoo! 00:12:51,673 --> 00:13:05,333 [Speaker 0] My good luck charm who I've known for 25 years. First met her in Vegas, um, as a sales executive up there when I first became original. Jodi Borelli, 32. Congratulations, Jodi. [applause] Whoo. 00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:10,333 [Speaker 0] And our good luck Danny Fan, who'll always- will always live on 00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:16,833 [Speaker 0] with all of us. He finished 31. Incredible. [applause] 00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:21,493 [Speaker 0] Wow. Terry, poor Terry. Where is he? He moved on. 00:13:21,493 --> 00:13:21,913 [Speaker 3] He stopped doing work. 00:13:21,913 --> 00:13:34,613 [Speaker 0] He's having a problem. [laughs] He finished 27 in six months. [laughs] Wow. Not bad. [applause] Lisa Murphey, you finished 22. Whoo! [applause] Out of 310. 00:13:34,613 --> 00:14:43,213 [Speaker 0] Cameron- Cameron finished 21. Uh, as measured by title only, number five total title and escrow revenue combined. And then if I break it down to the top 5%, I won't say whether or not you made five or two, because again, you're supposed to show up in Vegas, and that's when we're gonna tell you if you were five or two. Nathan Starks. Whoo! [applause] By the way, you're not Nathan. Nathan, we're completely changing your name. We're gonna do a forced intervention and change your name. It's Starks now. Starks. Yes, everything from here on out's gonna be Starks. You were 17 out of over 300 reps. Whoo! [applause] Mary Thompson, who's not here. Love Mary. She finished 15 out of that group. And then this next guy who I've just watched grown up, you know, from being a kid, with so much energy, so rambunctious. Great golfer, even back then. And always super good-looking. But boy has he put it all together, and time has- is- is- has helped him to mature. He finished 12 out of everybody in Southern California, Chris Jones. Whoo! [applause] 00:14:43,213 --> 00:15:02,173 [Speaker 0] Wow. And then our one and our only, she is, as you guys all know, an, um, a complete unicorn. Um, impossible to replicate, possibly to duplicate, um, because it's authenticity and energy, um, and just a love for people and the love of life that just 00:15:02,173 --> 00:15:18,993 [Speaker 0] causes this person to be who she is. And that's Christine Thompson. She finished five. And she finished number two if you combined her title and her escrow revenue together, and she's our flag bearer, and I know we're all so very proud of her. Congratulations, Christine. [applause] 00:15:18,993 --> 00:16:21,913 [Speaker 0] And the last person I wanna recognize, I know he's here 'cause I love the blue sweater that he's got on, but Joe Salvatore is another guy who's really a unicorn. He focuses on selling escrow. And as you all know, everybody here in this room all knows how difficult it is to cross-sell escrow. It is just a minefield. You know, when every one of your big broker customers owns their own escrow company, go try that on for size, you guys. Go try to go step out your door in the morning and generate over $3.2 million in revenue knowing everywhere you step is enemy territory. And he is- he's able to do that year in, year out. And it's a remarkable achievement. You know, the- the branch that he oversees is- is one of the most successful branches that we have in Southern California. Just gigantic, gigantic accomplishment. And we're so lucky to have him. Uh, just a- a couple of comments about the market, and, you know, kinda how we're looking at this year. But here's some good news. I'm not gonna take an hour and a half. I think I'm already up to 29 minutes, so, so he's gonna have to go really fast. [laughs] Um, 00:16:21,913 --> 00:16:31,273 [Speaker 0] you know, uh, because I've had a few people that have been asking me about what we think is- is gonna happen, you know, this year. You know, like I said last year, you have to go back to 1990-
